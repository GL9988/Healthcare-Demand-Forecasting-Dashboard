# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard – Demand, Efficiency & Forecasting  
Interactive Tableau dashboard suite designed to help healthcare decision-makers understand patient needs, optimize specialty performance, and prepare for future resource allocation.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary  
As part of a business analytics project, I developed a series of Tableau dashboards along with three teammates, analyzing 13,000+ anonymous patient records across the U.S. The goal was to translate raw data into actionable insights for healthcare providers, focusing on patient behavior, specialty performance, and operational delays.  

📈 The dashboards may support real-world decisions like:  
- **Resource allocation by state and age group**  
- **Consultation and lab time optimization**  
- **ICD-10-based diagnosis tracking**  
- **Demand forecasting for Q1 2025**

## 📊 Dashboard Overviews  

### 📍 1. Patient Volume & Demographics  
Visualizes trends across time, gender, ethnicity, and geography.  
✔️ Identifies **high-volume states** (TX, CA), **age segments** (45–64 & <15), and **daily visit patterns**.  
➡️ Helps allocate regional resources and tailor care programs.

### 📍 2. Provider Specialty Analysis  
Displays visit volumes, age distributions, growth trends, and prescribed medications.  
✔️ Reveals that **Pediatrics handles 90.7% of under-18s**, and **General/Internal Medicine** cover most adults.  
➡️ Informs staffing, drug planning, and specialty hiring.

### 📍 3. Care Demand & Disease Drivers  
Tracks top ICD-10 codes, repeat visit ratios, patient complaints, and visit reasons.  
✔️ Highlights **Depressive Disorder NEC** as most frequent condition; **Cough, sore throat, progress visits** are top patient reasons.  
➡️ Enables targeted interventions and chronic care planning.

### 📍 4. Operational Efficiency – Consultation Time  
Benchmarks time spent per specialty and patient condition.  
✔️ Psychiatry, Oncology, and Allergy require longest visits; Pediatrics and Dermatology are fastest.  
➡️ Suggests workflow standardization to reduce bottlenecks.

### 📍 5. Operational Efficiency – Lab Result Turnaround  
Analyzes lab test result time per diagnosis and specialty.  
✔️ OB/GYN and Oncology show **lab result delays over 30 days** on average.  
➡️ Supports lab workflow redesign and result prioritization.
