# 🏥 Healthcare Demand & Operational Insights Dashboard  
Interactive Tableau dashboard designed to uncover patient behavior trends, specialty performance, and care delivery bottlenecks using real-world healthcare data.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project visualizes over 13,000 anonymized patient records to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare operations. It enables hospital teams to forecast demand, optimize scheduling, and identify operational inefficiencies across consultation and lab services.

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- **Patient Demographics**: Majority aged 45–64 and under 15; highest patient counts in Texas (1,454) and California (1,374).  
- **Top Specialties**: Pediatrics handles 90%+ of patients under 18; General/Family Practice and Internal Medicine lead middle-aged and elderly care.  
- **Operational Metrics**: Ophthalmology and Psychiatry have longest consultation times; lab turnaround delays are severe in Oncology and OB-GYN.  
- **Forecasting**: Azithromycin, Ibuprofen, and Aspirin predicted to surge in 2025 Q1; Depressive Disorder NEC remains top ICD-10 diagnosis.
